/*
Kali Note
I should note that during testing the gun could honest to god have it's fire delay as low as 0
And it would still not be kinda eh.
The differences now is that this is atleast something you could viably pull out in an emergency
as opposed to "I literally do not have anything else and I cannot melee it"
Because the majority of the antagonist ran on this server can be shoved down or stunned.
Which make the murphy paradoxically awful for security
Because it make them do things they shouldn't while also being a gun that is objectively worse than nothing.
This is netiher, this is actually better than nothing. While being balanced around mid to late round antagonist with the weaker starting ammo (That you switch out to HP or AP)
Less Damage, more Ammo. It keeps armour actually relevant for antagonist, HP ammo for simple mob and unarmoured target. AP Ammo for mid to late round against armoured thraet (But with notably less damage per hit)
This is fair and nice.
